[Development of Courses and Programs]

    When it comes to developing and teaching online courses related around IT, George Brown College seems to be in a bit of an ideation phase.

    Instructors today, will talk about ideas for developments and changes the courses will experience tomorrow. 
    On one hand, that does give me, a student, a positive feeling that I'm studying under the roof of a more progressive/forward-thinking institution.
    On the other hand, it means I'm learning about these interesting new developments that won't have reached fruition until after I've already graduated.
    The one "saving grace" regarding this for me is that I'm considering taking one of the post-grad specialized programs.

[Development of Courses and Programs]

    When it comes to developing and teaching online courses related around IT, George Brown College seems to be in a bit of an ideation phase.

    Instructors today, will talk about ideas for developments and changes the courses will experience tomorrow. 
    On one hand, that does give me, a student, a positive feeling that I'm studying under the roof of a more progressive/forward-thinking institution.
    On the other hand, it means I'm learning about these interesting new developments that won't have reached fruition until after I've already graduated.
    The one "saving grace" regarding this for me is that I'm considering taking one of the post-grad specialized programs. 


[Post-graduate Tech Programs]

    These post-grad programs have titles like "Applied A.I Solutions Development", or "Information Systems Business Analysis", or the likely ever-popular "Cyber Security Program".
    The one potential downside for me in taking one of those programs, is that none of them are catered toward fully-online students.
    However, I think it should be possible to-- if I develop a positive enough rapport with the instructors of the courses-- figure out some arrangement that might involve me doing the classes/studying online,
        but showing up in-person for major assessments i.e. midterms/exams.

Devops is an interesting field of study. The process of collaberation and how to smoothly integrate the work of 
many contributors is doubtless integral to the modern process of app development. The professor seems not only 
quite familiar with the material but also quite passionate about delivering it in a timely fashion.

The professor of this class does an excellent job making sure all needed resources are availible to us. From 
lecture recordings to slides and links all relavent material is provided in a timely manner. The professor is 
also willing to stay on a subject a little longer to make sure everyone is caught up to where we need to be, 
ensuring they can succeed at the labs.

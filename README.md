## Group 42, COMP2156 - DevOps for System Administration

### Group Members

- Nicolas Szymanski: https://github.com/stavica

### Structure

Each group member has their own branch. Within their branch, they have three text files. The first basic goal of this assignment is that they populate these files with relevant information over time, making commits as they add new things to those textfiles.

Towards the end of the assignment and after a certain number of commits made per individual group member, all three branches will be merged into the `main` branch. Any conflicts from the merges will be reviewed and resolved.

This readme file will be updated over time to reflect our progress.

Progress Updates:

02/15/24 > Files in the 101444936-Vince branch are complete and ready to be merged to main.

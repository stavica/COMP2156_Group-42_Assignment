DevOps engineers play a very importanrt role in a software development cycle. They bridge the gap between 
development and operations teams. DevOps is a set of practices that tries toimprove and automate the 
collaboration and communication between the development side and IT operations side.

Here are some key aspects highlighting the importance of a DevOps engineer:

    Faster Development and Deployment: DevOps practices emphasize automation, which enables faster and more 
    frequent releases. This speed is essential in today's competitive software development landscape, allowing 
    organizations to quickly respond to market demands and changes.

    Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): DevOps engineers implement CI/CD pipelines, 
    which automate the process of integrating code changes, testing them, and deploying them to production. 
    This leads to more reliable and frequent releases, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall 
    software quality.

    Collaboration: DevOps promotes collaboration and communication between development, operations, and other 
    stakeholders. DevOps engineers help create a culture of collaboration, breaking down silos between teams, and 
    ensuring that everyone involved in the software development lifecycle works together seamlessly.

    This file contains my writings about the college's COMP2156 DevOps course.

[Labs & Hands-on Work, boosting hire-ability]

	The course attempts to give students like me and my peers some amount of hands-on experience
	with the kinds of tools that you might run into when you're in a DevOps position for a team.
	However, I feel like that's missed is that a lot of the "kind" of work you might do here is 
	going to be relevant to someone in the IT field even if they are never working alongside a
	software development team. 

	Being able to navigate Github, or be more familiar with setting up python/other environments
	is extremely useful for all kinds of system management work. There are lots of tools out there
	that already exist which can aid in or outright automate a variety of tasks that a person might
	run into in their working life in the IT field.
	
	Likewise, having an understanding of how those tools are made, and being able to make some yourself
	can give a pretty serious boost to your hire-ability if you're able to demonstrate the things you've
	made in your portfolio. Being proficient in powershell, shell, and python scripting are extremely useful
	and are no doubt hire-able skills.
